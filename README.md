# Code-Example

This is a contact form I made for my Asian Leopard Cat, Darwin. I have used Reactjs, Ant Design Component Library, Less, and JSON Prototyping API.

While a simple application, the code demonstrates a bredth of common activities and design patterns I use frequently in my front end development.


Run locally:

Step 1: Clone

Step 2: run 'yarn install'

Sep 3: run 'yarn start'

step 4: In a new console tab, run 'yarn start:devapi'


Note: Results of form submissions are stored in a protoyping database found in 'devApi/db.json'
